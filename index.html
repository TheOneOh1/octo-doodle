        <h1>About Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI can be classified into two categories: narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task, and general AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI applications include machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and more. These technologies are used in a variety of fields, such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI has the potential to transform our lives in many ways, from improving medical diagnoses to automating mundane tasks. However, it also raises ethical and societal questions that need to be addressed.
